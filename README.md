# Air Quality Monitoring using Tableau üå¨Ô∏è


## üìù Overview
This Tableau Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of India's air pollution levels in relation to environmental policy changes. By utilizing the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India, this dashboard offers insights into air quality trends across different states or regions in India over the years.

## üåç Context
With increasing concerns about environmental pollution and its detrimental effects on public health, understanding air quality variations and their correlation with policy changes becomes crucial. This project delves into the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between air quality metrics and environmental policy interventions in India.

## üìä Dashboard Components
1. **Map Visualization**: Utilize geographical maps to visualize air quality levels across different states or regions in India. Map markers are color-coded based on the air quality index (AQI) or other relevant metrics for easy interpretation.
   
2. **Time Series Charts**: Create time series line charts to depict changes in air quality over the years. Group the data by months or years to identify patterns and trends in air quality variations.
   
3. **Policy Change Timeline**: Integrate a timeline component to showcase key environmental policy changes in India. Highlight these policy change events on the timeline to observe correlations with air quality variations.
   
4. **Filter Options**: Implement filters for users to select specific states, time periods, or pollutant types. Allow users to customize their views based on their interests or research questions.
   
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Include comparative charts to showcase air quality comparisons between different states or regions. Utilize bar charts or line charts to illustrate variations in air quality metrics.
   
6. **Top Pollutant Analysis**: Identify and display the top pollutants contributing to poor air quality. Utilize bar charts or pie charts to represent the proportion of each pollutant.
   
7. **Insightful Annotations**: Use annotations to highlight specific data points, events, or trends that stand out in the analysis. Provide context and explanations for these annotations to facilitate understanding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Build the Dashboard
1. **Connect to Data**: Import the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data into Tableau for analysis.
   
2. **Design Dashboard Layout**: Plan and design the layout of the dashboard to ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
   
3. **Create Worksheets**: Develop visualizations such as maps, charts, and timelines to represent the data effectively.
   
4. **Apply Filters**: Implement filters to enable users to customize their views and focus on specific aspects of the data.
   
5. **Implement Interactivity**: Enhance user experience by adding interactive elements such as tooltips, hover effects, and click actions.
   
6. **Timeline Integration**: Integrate the policy change timeline component to provide context and insights into environmental policy interventions.
   
7. **Map Integration**: Incorporate map visualizations to spatially represent air quality variations across different regions in India.
   
8. **Test and Refine**: Thoroughly test the dashboard for functionality, usability, and visual appeal. Refine as necessary to ensure a seamless user experience.
   
9. **Document Insights**: Provide detailed documentation of key findings, insights, and observations derived from the analysis.
   
10. **Publish and Share**: Publish the Tableau Dashboard and share it with stakeholders, researchers, policymakers, and the general public to facilitate awareness and informed decision-making regarding air quality and environmental policies in India.

## üéâ Conclusion
This Tableau Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for exploring and understanding India's air pollution levels in the context of environmental policy changes. By leveraging interactive visualizations and comprehensive data analysis, it offers valuable insights into the dynamics of air quality across different states or regions over time.
